Subject: Recommender for Movies Based on TFIDF Vectorization of Reviews

A movies dataset TMDb_updated.CSV (Version 55) was obtained on kaggle on Apr 12, 2021. https://www.kaggle.com/sankha1998/tmdb-top-10000-popular-movies-dataset/code

The reviews for the movies were TFIDF vectorized, transformed, and scored.

A tkinter GUI interface was created allowing an end user to input the name of a movie, and if it matches an existing title in the 9,000+ database, the top review for the move is displayed or a list of 10 similar movie choices is shown.
